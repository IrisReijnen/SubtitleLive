## Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up Ollama with Docker, Python, and Whisper

This guide will show you how to install and run Ollama in Docker, set up a Python environment, and install Whisper along with other required packages to run the script. We assume you already have Python and pip installed.

#### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

1. Download Docker Desktop from the official website.
2. Follow the installation steps for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. After installation, open Docker Desktop to make sure itâ€™s running properly.

#### Step 2: Install the Ollama Docker Image

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Pull the Ollama image by running this command:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codedocker pull ollama/llama3.1
    ```
3.  Check if the image is installed by running:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codedocker images
    ```

    You should see the Ollama image in the list.

#### Step 3: Set Up a Python Environment

1. Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open VS Code and install the Python extension.
3.  In your terminal (inside VS Code), create a virtual environment by running:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codepython -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   * On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5.  Install the required Python package with this command:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codepip install requests
    ```

#### Step 4: Install Whisper, Torch, and Sounddevice

1.  In the same terminal, install Whisper by running:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codepip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
    ```
2.  Install the `torch` library, which is required for Whisper:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codepip install torch
    ```
3.  Finally, install `sounddevice`, which is needed to handle audio input/output:

    ```bash
    bashCopy codepip install sounddevice
    ```

#### Step 5: Test the Setup (Script Coming Later)

* At this point, all necessary packages (`Whisper`, `torch`, and `sounddevice`) are installed, and your environment is ready to run the script once it is provided.

#### Conclusion

You have now installed Docker Desktop, pulled the Ollama image, set up a Python environment, installed Whisper, Torch, and Sounddevice. You are now prepared to run the script when it's ready.
