# Whisper

This tool was chosen because of the choices it was recommended as the quickest and most accurate. Which is most important for this project. Another important aspect is that Whisper is open-source and free.

There is a need for a noise proof microphone as the tool tends to pick up words or sentences that were never said.

Currently there is a problem where over time the translation takes longer and longer to appear on screen.
